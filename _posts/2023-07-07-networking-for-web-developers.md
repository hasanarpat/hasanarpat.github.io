### Networking for web Developers


<p>In this century everything gets more and more complexing. The internet is in the first place of course. So especially as web developers or developers generally we need to know basics of internet and it's protocols at least to work with it.</p>

<p>In this case software companies are asking questions like:<br/> <strong>"What do you know about Procotols, DNS, How a HTTP request works?..."</strong></p>

<p>So they asked me too. And I did'nt do it wery well actually even I have known generally and take the lessons such as Computer Networks and Network Programming. You can say the reason of my struggle and fail is excitement, I believe if you can't explain plain topics and idea of subject; it's good to have a look back on your knowledge and dig into subject.</p>

<p>So I decided to take Networking for Web Developers course on <a href="www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> which is free</p>

<blockquote>I really recommend anyone who wants to learn about networking, you will think much more detailed when coding and design your project as knowing what processes are going to work for example when you fetch data from an outside server.</blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Are The Topics You Should Take A Look</h2>

<p>
First you need to install these two program to work on a linux machine if you are using a windows machine.

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>
    </li>
</ul>
You will also need a Unix-style terminal program. On Mac or Linux systems, you can use the built-in Terminal. On Windows, I recommend Hyper.js which is a great and customizable terminal.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Internet Protocols
    </li>
    <li>
        ping
    </li>
    <li>
        netcat
    </li>
    <li>
        tcpdump
    </li>
    <li>
        Ports
    </li>
    <li>
        IPv4 and IPv6
    </li>
    <li>
        How to work with ip addresses and IP Dividing
    </li>
    <li>
        TCP/IP
    </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>These are what you should learn within course.</blockquote>

<p>So you can start to learn with this course. I hope you made it already.</p>
